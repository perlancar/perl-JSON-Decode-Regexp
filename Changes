Revision history for JSON-Decode-Regexp

0.04    2016-02-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Optimization] reuse previous array/hash when building
	  array/object, this results in several times of speed increase
	  when parsing longer arrays/objects.

	- [Optimization] Move embedded code for object/array after '{'/'['
	  to avoid repeated execution.

	- [Optimization] We don't need to eval number, just use 0 + $^N.

	- Remove code that checks for duplicate key when specifying object
	  (JSON allows it).

	- Add JSON::Decode::RegexpDebug (not included in build, see the git repo
          directly).
