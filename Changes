Revision history for JSON-Decode-Regexp

0.06    2016-03-18 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add some error messages so parsing failure does not just return with
          'No match' but shows more detailed error messages and input position.
          This unfortunately slows down parsing a bit (~30% for short and simple
          input, but for more complex input & longer hash/array the overall
          overhead becomes smaller e.g. < 1% because the bottleneck is no longer
          the parsing but the data structure building.


0.05    2016-02-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Tweak description and FAQ item (note about performance as of
	  0.04), mention some other JSON modules.


0.04    2016-02-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Optimization] reuse previous array/hash when building
	  array/object, this results in several times of speed increase
	  when parsing longer arrays/objects.

	- [Optimization] Move embedded code for object/array after '{'/'['
	  to avoid repeated execution.

	- [Optimization] We don't need to eval number, just use 0 + $^N.

	- Remove code that checks for duplicate key when specifying object
	  (JSON allows it).

	- Add JSON::Decode::RegexpDebug (not included in build, see the git repo
          directly).
